## Upcoming Classes Panel

This project recreates the "Upcoming Classes" panel from the provided Figma design using React.js and TailwindCSS. Due to time constraints, I was unable to fully implement TypeScript and comprehensive unit testing. However, I have outlined below my plans to integrate these features in the near future.

### Future Improvements

- **TypeScript Integration:** I plan to refactor the codebase to use TypeScript, enhancing type safety and reducing runtime errors. This will involve converting JavaScript functions and components to TypeScript and defining interfaces for props and state.

- **Unit Testing:** I aim to write unit tests for the "Upcoming Classes" panel using Jest and React Testing Library. These tests will cover the component's rendering, event handlers, and state changes. Mocks and stubs will be used to isolate the component for testing.

- **Continuous Refinement:** Beyond TypeScript and unit testing, I am committed to continuously refining the component, considering performance optimizations, accessibility enhancements, and additional features suggested in the bonus points.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal and run:
   
    https://github.com/ShuhaibKVL/Elt_global.git

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies. This project uses npm as its package manager. Run:

    Alternatively, if you prefer Yarn, run:

    
3. **Running the Project Locally:**
   After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server to view the project in your browser. Execute the following command:

    Or, if you're using Yarn:

       This command starts the development server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

4. **Viewing the Project:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by the development server (typically `http://localhost:5173`). You should see the "Upcoming Classes" panel as designed in the Figma mockup.

### Notes:
- **Dependencies:** List any specific versions of packages that are crucial for the project to run correctly.
- **Environment Variables:** If your project relies on environment variables (e.g., API keys, database connections), provide instructions on setting them up.
- **Build Process:** If there's a build process involved (especially relevant if you're using frameworks like Next.js or Vite), mention how to run it.
- **Tests:** Although you've mentioned limited experience with unit testing, if you've managed to implement any tests, provide instructions on how to run them alongside the project setup.

This structured approach ensures that anyone who wants to run your project locally has a clear path to follow, starting from cloning the repository to viewing the project in their browser.```
